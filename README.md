The InventoryApp is meant to help users easily manage their inventory. It was designed to make it simple 
for users to add, edit, and view items and categories, ensuring everything stays organized. The app's screens 
and features were built with the user in mind, focusing on clear and easy-to-use designs.

Before coding, I spent time planning the app's layout and key features. This planning made the coding smoother
and helped me avoid problems later on. Testing was an important part of the process, as it helped me catch 
mistakes early and make sure the app worked well for users.

One of the main challenges was making the app easy to navigate. By making thoughtful changes along the way, 
I was able to create an app that users can rely on to manage their inventory. The success of the item and 
category management features showed that the app met its goals and worked well for its users.
